In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment in the OHBM Open
Science Demo Calls, we want participation in our project and our community to be
a harassment-free experience for everyone.
We therefore respect and promote diversity in all of our spaces, including the
GitHub repository, online calls, and accompanying live chat.

Although no list can hope to be all-encompassing, we explicitly honor diversity in age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, native language, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We aim to promote behavior that contributes to a positive and welcoming environment.
Examples of such behavior include:

* Using inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Showing empathy towards other community members

We do not tolerate harassment or other, inappropriate behavior in our community spaces.
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Insulting/derogatory comments about a project or its maintainer(s), and
  personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Repeated off-topic remarks with an intent to disrupt or derail ongoing
  conversation

## Our Responsibilities

The host and appointed moderators are responsible for clarifying the standards
of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The host and appointed moderators have the right and responsibility to remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within OHBM Open Science Demo Calls online spaces
and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS].
Confidentiality will be respected in reporting.

*SUBJECT: Invitation to speak on the OHBM Open Science Demo Call | **[DATE OF CALL]***

Hi **[GUEST NAME]**,

We on the OHBM Open Science SIG committee have started to run Open Science Demo Calls where I chat for about 10 minutes each with members of our community who are doing some cool open science. Here's a blog post highlighting one of the previous calls: https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/february-ohbm-open-science-demo-call.

**[SUGGESTOR NAME]** suggested that you could talk about **[PROJECT NAME]** and I was wondering if you (and any of your team mates) would like to be featured on our call on **[DATE OF CALL]** at 7pm GMT?

There's more information at https://github.com/ohbm/OpenScienceDemoCalls.

**[OPTIONAL]**(I also sent you all of this on slack, so feel free to reply using whichever medium works best for you!)

Thank you!
Kirstie

*SUBJECT: Invitation to speak on the OHBM Open Science Demo Call | February 1st*

Hi Tim,

We on the OHBM Open Science SIG committee have started to run Open Science Demo Calls where I chat for about 10 minutes each with members of our community who are doing some cool open science. Here's a blog post highlighting one of the previous calls: https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/february-ohbm-open-science-demo-call.

I recently reviewed Porcupine and I really liked it, so I was wondering if you (and any of your co-authors) would like to be featured on our first call on 1st February at 7pm GMT?

*SUBJECT: OHBM Open Science Demo Call | **[DATE OF CALL]** | 6:50pm GMT*

Hi **[GUEST 1]**, **[GUEST 2]** and **[GUEST 3]**,

Thank you all for agreeing to be on our Open Science demo call.

Elizabeth (cc-d) and I have written up a guide for guests which I hope will let you know a little more about what to expect: https://github.com/ohbm/OpenScienceDemoCalls/blob/master/guides/GuideForGuests.md.

I'm also about to send you a google calendar invitation which has a link to the hangouts on air that we'll be broadcasting from :)

There are two important actions on your end:

1. Fill in this form - https://goo.gl/forms/3foIuNP9G7kmCW193 - so we can turn around a blog post very quickly after the call.
2. Find a time to check your google hangouts connection (I'm happy to be the test person if you're not sure).

I think the best running order is:

* Guest 1
* Guest 2
* Guest 3

but I really don't mind if you have strong opinions about wanting to mix that up.

I'll introduce you and the concept of the call first, and I'll close out the call.

Please take a look at the guide and let me know if you have any questions. And most importantly, please **let me know that you've received this email and you're all set for the call** because I always get a little nervous that they aren't going through! :smiley:

Thanks again, and I look forward to seeing you on Thursday!

Kx

# Open Science Demo Calls

*A monthly [google hangout](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ) to show off some of the fantastic projects built by members of the OHBM Open Science community*.

### What are Demo Calls?

Demo calls are a chance to hear from the developers of open neuroimaging tools: resources you may use (or want to use), but don't know much about. Why did a developer make a tool, and make it openly available? What was their process for creating it? How do they see it being used? How do they hope it will grow in the future? How can **you** get involved?

Demo calls are a great chance to find out about tools and initiatives (both old and new) you may not have heard of yet. The open neuroimaging community is great and growing every day. We'll use these calls to build connections between all members of the OHBM Open Science community and to tell the stories of the people making outstanding and reproducible neuroscience happen.

### When do they take place?

Demo calls happen (usually) on the last Thursday of the month at 7pm GMT.

* First call: [Thursday 1st February 2018, 7pm GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180201T190000&p1=tz_gmt). 
  * Note that this call is a week late because [Kirstie](https://github.com/kirstiejane), our host, has concert tickets on the last Thursday of January :grimacing:
* Second call: [Thursday 22nd February 2018, 7pm GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180222T190000&p1=tz_gmt). 

### Where can I find them?

The calls will be livestreamed on YouTube from the [OHBM OpenScience Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ).

All recordings will be archived on the channel for easy access.

### How do I stay in touch?

Please join our OHBM Open Science SIG mailing list :construction: ***Not sure where to host this! All comments welcome*** :construction:

### How do I appear on a future demo call?

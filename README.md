# Open Science Demo Calls

A collection of resources for the OHBM Open Science Demo Calls.

### What are Demo Calls?

Demo calls are a chance to hear from the developers of open science tools&mdash; resources you may use (or want to use), but haven't heard the story behind. Why did a developer make a tool, and make it openly available? What was their process for creating it? How do they see it being used? How do they hope it will grow in the future?

Demo calls are also a great chance to find out about tools (both old and new) you may not have heard of yet. The open neuroimaging community is great and growing. Demo calls are a chance to check in once a month and hear about the people who make this community every day. 

### When do they take place?

Demo calls happen on the last Thursday of the month at 7pm GMT.

* First call: [Thursday 25th January 2018, 7pm GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180125T190000&p1=tz_gmt). 

### Where can I find them?

The calls will be livestreamed on YouTube from the [OHBM OpenScience Channel]().
All recordings will be archived on the channel for easy access.
